### âœ… Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (automatic with App Engine)
- [ ] Session management working
- [ ] Password hashing verified
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Input validation working

## Production Configuration

### âœ… Environment Variables (in app.yaml)
```yaml
env_variables:
  SECRET_KEY: "your-production-secret-key-here"
  WEATHER_API_KEY: "your-weatherstack-api-key"
  FLASK_ENV: "production"
```

### âœ… Auto-scaling Settings
- [ ] Min instances: 1
- [ ] Max instances: 10
- [ ] CPU utilization target: 60%
- [ ] Scaling verified under load

### âœ… Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Google Cloud Logging enabled
- [ ] Error reporting configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Alerting rules set up (optional)

## Demo Data Verification

### âœ… Database Initialization
- [ ] Demo user created: `demo@dudeandirt.com`
- [ ] Sample services available (6 services)
- [ ] Sample bookings for demo user
- [ ] Seeds calculation working (625 total seeds)

### âœ… Demo Flow Testing
1. [ ] Login with demo credentials
2. [ ] View dashboard with stats
3. [ ] Complete booking flow
4. [ ] Check seeds & rewards page
5. [ ] View receipts timeline
6. [ ] Browse product catalog
7. [ ] Update profile information

## Final Checks
